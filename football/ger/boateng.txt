Jérôme Agyenim Boateng (German pronunciation: [?e'?o?m bo.a't??]; born 3 September 1988) is a German professional footballer who plays as a defender for Bayern Munich and the Germany national team.

Boateng started his career at Hertha BSC where he developed from the youth ranks to the main team. After his first season at Hertha, he soon signed for Hamburger SV and established himself as an integral part of the team, helping Hamburg reach the two consecutive UEFA Europa League semi-finals. After one season in England with Manchester City, he joined Bayern Munich in 2011 and has since won domestic and European honours with the club, notably the continental treble in the 2012–13 season.

Boateng played in the Germany under-21 side, which won the 2009 Euro U-21 Championship and was soon promoted to the national side. Boateng has since accumulated over 70 caps and represented Germany at UEFA Euro 2012, Euro 2016, 2010 World Cup, 2014 World Cup, and 2018 World Cup. He was a key member of his country's victory in the 2014 World Cup. He is the younger half-brother of fellow footballer Kevin-Prince Boateng.

Boateng has played for the German under-17 and under-19 national teams. On 5 July 2007 he was called up to the German under-19 squad by coach Frank Engel[51] for the 2007 UEFA European Under-19 Championship held in Austria, from 16 July until 27 July.[52]

Boateng is also a former Germany under-21 international and won with the team the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He made his debut with the Germany senior team on 10 October 2009 against Russia, becoming the first German international to get sent off on his debut; he received a second booking in the second half.[53] Despite this shaky start, he was called up regularly ever since.
