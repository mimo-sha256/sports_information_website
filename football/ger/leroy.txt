Leroy Aziz Sané (German pronunciation: ['li???? za'ne?]; born 11 January 1996) is a German professional footballer who plays as a winger and as an attacking midfielder for Premier League club Manchester City and the German national team.

He made his professional debut for Schalke 04 in 2014 and transferred to Manchester City in 2016 for an initial £37 million fee. He was voted PFA Young Player of the Year in 2017–18 after helping City win the Premier League and EFL Cup, a feat the side bettered by winning a domestic treble the following season.

Sané made his senior international debut for Germany in November 2015 and was part of their squad that reached the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 2016.

Sané was selected by Germany boss Joachim Löw to represent the country at UEFA Euro 2016.[59] He participated in one match, replacing Bastian Schweinsteiger on 79 minutes in Germany's 2–0 semi-final defeat to France.[60]

Sané was eligible to play for France because he holds French citizenship.[61]

Sané was omitted from Germany's final 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in favour of another young player Julian Brandt on 4 June 2018.[62] In September 2018, after he was selected for the squad to face games against France and Peru, he left the team hotel after a discussion with Joachim Löw, citing "personal reasons" as his cause for leaving.[63] It was later revealed that the reason for leaving was due to the birth of his daughter.[64][65]

On 16 November 2018 he scored his first goal for Germany against Russia following an assist from Serge Gnabry. The goal came in the eighth minute of the game as Germany won 3–0
