Daley Blind (Dutch pronunciation: [d?ili bl?nt]; born 9 March 1990) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder, left-back or centre-back for Ajax and the Netherlands national team. He is the son of former Ajax defender and former Netherlands national team manager Danny Blind.[4]

Blind rose through the youth ranks at Ajax, becoming a regular after a loan to Groningen, and won four consecutive Eredivisie titles with the club. In September 2014, he transferred to Manchester United for £13.8 million, where he was part of the team that won four trophies including the FA Cup, EFL Cup and UEFA Europa League. In the summer of 2018, Blind returned to Ajax where he won his fifth Eredivisie title and first-ever KNVB Cup in his first season back at the club.

A full international since 2013, he has earned more than 60 caps and was a member of the Dutch squad that finished third at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Having had previous call-ups, Blind made his debut for the Netherlands senior team on 6 February 2013, in the starting left-back position, against Italy in a friendly encounter at the Amsterdam Arena. The match ended in a 1–1 draw, with Blind playing the full 90 minutes.[30]

In June 2014, he was selected in the Netherlands squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He was a starter at left wing-back for the team's opening match against Spain, assisting goals for Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben, as the Oranje won 5–1.[31] He scored his first goal for the Netherlands in a 3–0 defeat of Brazil in the third-place play-off.
