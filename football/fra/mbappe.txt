In 2017, Mbappé signed for league rivals Paris Saint-Germain on an initial loan, which was made permanent a year later in a transfer worth €180 million, making him the second most expensive player, and most expensive teenager, ever.[8] In Paris, Mbappé won two Ligue 1 titles, a Coupe de France title, and a Coupe de la Ligue title, which included a domestic treble in his debut season, and finished as the league's top goalscorer and Player of the Year in his second season.
