Sergio Busquets Burgos (Catalan: [bus'k?ts],[3] Spanish: ['se?xjo ßus'kets];[A] born 16 July 1988) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder and is the vice-captain of Barcelona and the Spain national team. Busquets is widely regarded as one of the greatest defensive midfielders of his generation, and by some to be among the finest of modern era.[4][5][6][7]

A one-club man, he arrived in Barcelona's first team in July 2008, and eventually made a name for himself in a relatively short period of time. He reached the Spain national team less than one year after making his senior club debut.

Busquets helped Spain win the 2010 World Cup and the Euro 2012 tournaments. He also represented the nation at two other World Cups and Euro 2016.

Busquets was selected by manager Vicente del Bosque for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, assuming the holding midfielder role naturalized Brazilian Marcos Senna had previously occupied in the conquest of UEFA Euro 2008.[45] He played all of the tournament's games and minutes for the eventual world champions, save the last 30 minutes of the 0–1 group-stage loss against Switzerland.[46]

On 8 September 2014, Busquets scored his first international goal in a 5–1 win over Macedonia during Euro 2016's qualifying phase.[47] His second came during the same tournament on 15 November, in the 3–0 defeat of Belarus in Huelva.[48]

Busquets celebrated his 100th appearance for Spain on 9 October 2017, in a 1–0 away win against Israel for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers.[49] Subsequently, he was named in Julen Lopetegui's squad for the finals in Russia
