Jesús Navas González (Spanish pronunciation: [xe'suz 'naßaz ?on'?ale?];[a] born 21 November 1985) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a right winger or a right back for Sevilla and the Spanish national team. His main assets are his quick dribbling and an ability to run at opposing defenders.[2][3][4]

He spent the vast majority of his career with Sevilla, playing 481 official matches and winning six major titles, including two UEFA Cups and two Copas del Rey. In 2013 he signed for Manchester City, where he won the 2013–14 Premier League; he re-joined the former in 2017, breaking the club record for most competitive appearances.

A Spanish international since 2009, Navas helped his country win the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012, earning over 30 caps and scoring four goals.

Called up for the World Cup final stages in South Africa, Navas scored his first goal as an international on 3 June 2010 in a warm-up friendly with South Korea, netting the game's only goal four minutes from time.[45] In the tournament itself he appeared in three matches, including 30 minutes plus extra time in the final against the Netherlands as Spain lifted its first FIFA World Cup trophy.[46]

Navas was also selected for UEFA Euro 2012, where he appeared in several games for the eventual champions as a substitute. On 18 June 2012, he scored the game's only goal in the 87th minute of the last group stage fixture against Croatia, handing Spain the first place in Group C: he netted from point-blank range, following an assist by Iniesta.[47]

Picked for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, Navas making three appearances from the bench. On 27 June, in the semi-finals against Italy, he scored the decisive penalty in the shootout (0–0 after 120 minutes).[48]

Navas was one of seven players cut from Spain's final squad for the 2014 World Cup, alongside City teammate Álvaro Negredo.[49] On 15 March 2019, after almost six years of absence from international duty, the 33-year-old returned to the national setup for Euro 2020 qualifying matches against Norway and Malta to be held late in that month
