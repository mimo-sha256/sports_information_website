Jorge Luiz Frello Filho, best known as Jorginho (Italian: [(d)?or'(d)?i??o], Brazilian Portuguese: [???'?ij~u]; born 20 December 1991) is a professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Chelsea and the Italy national team. He is currently Chelsea's vice-captain behind César Azpilicueta.[3]

Born in Brazil, Jorginho moved to Italy at the age of 15, and began his professional career with the Verona youth team, before being promoted to the senior team. During the 2010–11 season, he was sent on loan to Sambonifacese. In January 2014, he moved to Napoli, where he soon after won the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa Italiana. He totaled 160 games for the club before a £50 million move to Chelsea in 2018, where he won the UEFA Europa League in his first season.

At international level, he has represented Italy, making his senior debut in 2016, while his competitive debut came the following year.

In 2014, Jorginho expressed his desire to represent Italy rather than Brazil internationally,[32] and he received his first call up to the Italy senior squad in March 2016, under manager Antonio Conte, for the team's international friendlies against Spain and Germany.[33] He made his international debut for Italy on 24 March, coming on as a last-minute substitute for Marco Parolo in a 1–1 draw against Spain at the Stadio Friuli in Udine.[34] After initially being included in Conte's preliminary 30-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016, on 31 May, Jorginho was later excluded from the final 23-man squad.[35]

In spite of his positive club form for Napoli, Jorginho was not initially called up to the Italian side under Conte's successor, Gian Piero Ventura. Although rumours circled in the media regarding the possibility of Brazil's coach Tite calling Jorginho up to his squad in autumn 2017, as he had not yet appeared for Italy in a competitive match, Jorginho denied rumours that he wanted to switch to the Brazilian national team.[36][37][38][39][40] He later made his first competitive appearance for Italy under manager Ventura in a 0–0 home draw against Sweden on 13 November, in the second leg of the World Cup play-offs against Sweden, at the San Siro in Milan; however, Italy's 1–0 away loss in the first leg on 10 November saw Sweden advance on aggregate, meaning that Italy had failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 60 years.[41]

On 7 September 2018, in Italy's first UEFA Nations League match at home to Poland in Bologna, Jorginho scored his first international goal from the penalty spot to secure a 1–1 draw.[42][43] On 8 September 2019, he scored his second international goal, from the penalty spot once again, in a 2–1 away win over Finland, in a Euro 2020 qualifier.[44] On 12 October, Jorginho scored his third international goal, once again from a penalty kick, in a 2–0 home win over Greece, which sealed Italy's qualification for Euro 2020.
