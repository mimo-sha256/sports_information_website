Lorenzo Insigne (Italian pronunciation: [lo'r?ntso in'si??e]; born 4 June 1991) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Napoli, for which he is captain, and the Italy national team.

Insigne began his professional career with Napoli in 2009, making his Serie A debut in 2010, but was later sent on consecutive season loan spells to Cavese, Foggia and Pescara, before returning to Napoli in 2012. Insigne is capable of playing on either flank, or through the centre, but is usually deployed as left winger. He is known in particular for his creativity, speed and technical ability, as well as his accuracy from free-kicks.[4]

Insigne has represented the Italy national under-21 team, with which he won a runner-up medal at the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He made his debut for the senior team in September 2012, and has represented Italy at the 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016

On 20 June, Insigne made his debut in the 2014 World Cup in Italy's second group match, against Costa Rica, replacing Antonio Candreva in the second half. However, this was Insigne's only appearance in the tournament, as Italy was eliminated in the group stage.[44]

On 31 May 2016, Insigne was named to Antonio Conte's 23-man Italy squad for UEFA Euro 2016.[45] He made his first appearance of the tournament on 22 June, coming off the bench in Italy's final group match, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to the Republic of Ireland, striking the post and later receiving a yellow card in injury time.[46] In the round of 16, at the Stade de France in Paris on 27 June, he came off the bench once again to help set-up Graziano Pellè's 91st minute volley to give the Azzurri a 2–0 win over defending champions Spain.[47] On 2 July, he made a further substitute appearance in the quarter-final fixture against Germany and scored Italy's first penalty in the resulting shoot-out, which ended in a 6–5 loss to the reigning World Cup champions
