Lucas Tolentino Coelho de Lima (Brazilian Portuguese: ['luka? pak?'ta]; born 27 August 1997), or simply Lucas Paquetá, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Serie A Milan and the Brazil national team.

Lucas Paquetá arrived at Flamengo in 2007 at the age of 10. At the age of 15, he was very technically skilled but did not have the physicality of other players his age (he was only 5 ft tall). By age 18, however, he had grown 27 cm (10.6 inches). With the Flamengo youth team he won the 2016 Copa São Paulo de Júniores title, the most important youth tournament in Brazil. Alongside other standout players Léo Duarte, Felipe Vizeu and Ronaldo, Lucas was promoted the club's professional team right after the competition.

In 2018, he was selected to be one of the twelve alternatives for the Brazilian national team by coach Tite for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Of the 35 players on the 23-man roster and provisional roster, Lucas was the youngest.[15]

On 17 August 2018, Paquetá was called for the first time for the Brazilian national team by manager Tite to play in friendly matches against United States and El Salvador in September.[16] On 7 September, he made his debut with the national team, coming off the bench to replace Philippe Coutinho in the 71st minute during a friendly match against the United States.[17] On 23 March 2019, he scored his first goal in a 1–1 friendly draw against Panama, wearing Brazil's iconic No. 10 shirt.[18] In May 2019, he was included in Brazil's 23-man squad for the 2019 Copa América.
