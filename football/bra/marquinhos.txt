Marcos Aoás Corrêa (born 14 May 1994), commonly known as Marquinhos (Brazilian Portuguese: [ma?'kij~us]), is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a defender for Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. Mainly a central defender, he can also play as a right-back or a defensive midfielder.

He began his career at Corinthians, and after winning the 2012 Copa Libertadores he moved to Roma for an eventual fee of €3 million. Marquinhos was a regular in his only season as Roma reached the Coppa Italia Final. In July 2013, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain for €31.4 million on a five-year contract, one of the highest fees for a player under the age of 20.[3][4][5] He won 18 items of silverware at the club, including five Ligue 1 titles. Marquinhos played less frequently after the acquisition of compatriot David Luiz in 2014,[6][7] returning to an integral role after the latter was sold in 2016.[8]
