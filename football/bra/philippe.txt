Philippe Coutinho Correia (Brazilian Portuguese: [fi'lipi kow't?i?u]; born 12 June 1992) is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder or winger for Bundesliga club Bayern Munich on loan from Barcelona and the Brazilian national team. He is known for his combination of vision, passing, dribbling and ability to conjure curving long-range strikes.[4]

Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Coutinho showed prodigious talent and excelled in Vasco da Gama's youth system. He was signed by Italian club Inter Milan in 2008 for €4 million and subsequently loaned back to Vasco, where he became a key player. He made his debut for Inter Milan in 2010, and was later loaned to La Liga club Espanyol in 2012. In January 2013, Coutinho joined English club Liverpool for £8.5 million. He flourished at Liverpool and earned himself the nickname "The Magician" from Liverpool fans and teammates.[4] After he was named in the PFA Team of the Year in 2015.[5][6] In January 2018, Coutinho transferred to Barcelona in a record transaction fee reportedly worth €160 million, making him the world's second most expensive player.[7]

In the 2018–19 season, his first full season with Barcelona, the standard of Coutinho's performances distinctly fell, due to him being unsuited to play under the style of Barça coach, Ernesto Valverde, who operated him as a left wing within a front three in La Liga.[8] In 2019, Coutinho was loaned to German club Bayern Munich on a season-long loan.[9]

Coutinho made his senior international debut in 2010. He was part of the Brazilian squad at the 2015 Copa América, the Copa América Centenario in 2016, and made his World Cup debut at the 2018 FIFA World Cup where he scored two goals and was named to the FIFA World Cup Dream Team; he was also a member of the Brazilian team that won the 2019 Copa América on home soil.
