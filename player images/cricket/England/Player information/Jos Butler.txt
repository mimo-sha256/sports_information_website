Joseph Charles Buttler (born 8 September 1990) is an English international cricketer who is currently vice-captain of the England cricket team in limited overs cricket.[1] A right-handed batsman, he usually fields as a wicket-keeper and has represented England in Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket. He served as vice-captain of the England squad that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup, becoming world champions for the first time in their history.[2][3] He currently plays for Lancashire in English domestic cricket having previously played for Somerset.[4] He also plays for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League (IPL).[5] Buttler holds the record for the fastest ODI century by an England player and is regarded as one of the best wicket-keeper batsmen in the world.[6][7] Buttler's ability to recognise and manipulate field placements of opposing teams and score all around the ground has seen him labelled as a "360-degree" cricketer.[8][9][10]

Buttler enjoyed a prolific cricket record while at school, sharing a record-breaking opening partnership while at King's College, Taunton in 2008. The following season, his school lost only one of seventeen matches under his captaincy and he was named 2010 Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year. He made his Somerset first-team debut in 2009 after having played age-group cricket for the county. His performances led him to be selected to play for England at Under-19 level before he made his senior England debut in 2011 and his Test debut in 2014.


Born in Taunton, Somerset on 8 September 1990,[11] Buttler was educated at King's College, where he displayed his early talent in cricket.[12]
