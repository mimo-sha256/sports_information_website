Joseph Edward Root (born 30 December 1990) is an English international cricketer who is the current captain of the England Test team. He also represents Yorkshire domestically. He is currently ranked sixth in Test batting and eighth in ODI batting rankings according to the ICC Player Rankings, having previously been ranked the best Test batsman. Root was part of the England squad that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup.[1]

He was originally a right-handed opening batsman and occasional off-spinner, with a similar playing style to former England captain Michael Vaughan. However, he has played the majority of his cricket for England in the middle order. He made his debut for England in the 2012 Test series in India and made his ODI and Twenty20 International debuts on the same tour, before scoring his maiden Test century at his home ground of Headingley the following spring against New Zealand.

On the occasion of England's 1000th Test in August 2018, he was named in the country's greatest Test XI by the ECB.[2]

Root is the eldest son of Helen and Matt Root and grew up in Dore, Sheffield.[3] He has a younger brother Billy, who plays cricket for Glamorgan. He attended King Ecgbert School, Sheffield and at 15, on a cricket sports scholarship, Worksop College as a weekly boarder.[4]

Root followed in his father's footsteps by joining Sheffield Collegiate CC. Former Yorkshire batsman and England captain Michael Vaughan also learnt his trade at Collegiate and was a source of inspiration for Root, who became a protégé of his.[4][5][6] Root supports football team Sheffield United.[7]

Root became engaged to his girlfriend Carrie Cotterell in March 2016.[8] Their son Alfred William was born on 7 January 2017 and they married on 1 December 2018.[9][10]
