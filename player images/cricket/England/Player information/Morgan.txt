Eoin Joseph Gerard Morgan (born 10 September 1986) is an Irish-English cricketer who captains the England cricket team in limited overs cricket. A left-handed batsman, he plays county cricket for Middlesex and has played for England's Test, One Day International, (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) teams.

Under his captaincy, England won the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, becoming world champions for the first time. He previously played for the Ireland cricket team and was the first player to score an ODI hundred for two nations. His ability to hit boundaries at the end of innings sees him labelled as a "finisher"; he is also among the most skilful exponents of the reverse sweep shot.

After Alastair Cook was removed from the ODI captaincy on 19 December 2014, Morgan was named as the England captain for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, having already captained England in ODIs and T20Is as a stand-in. He is the only England captain to have scored more than 4 ODI centuries.

On 19 June 2018, during the third match of the home ODI series against Australia, Eoin Morgan surpassed the record of Ian Bell as the all-time leading run scorer for England in One Day International matches. In the same match Morgan also broke the England record for the fastest fifty in ODIs.

On 14 May 2019, in the third ODI match against Pakistan, Morgan became the most-capped player in ODIs for England, playing in his 198th match.[2] During the 2019 ICC World Cup, Morgan scored the highest number of sixes in an ODI innings, having scored 17 sixes against Afghanistan.
