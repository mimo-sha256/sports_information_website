Jofra Chioke Archer (born 1 April 1995) is a Barbadian-born English cricketer who plays internationally for England and in English domestic cricket for Sussex County Cricket Club. In April 2019, Archer was selected to play for the England cricket team in limited overs fixtures against Ireland and Pakistan. He made his international debut for England in May 2019, and was part of the England squad that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup. He then made his Test debut later that summer, against Australia in the 2019 Ashes series.

Jofra Chioke Archer was born on 1 April 1995 in Bridgetown, Barbados.[2] His father Frank Archer is English and his mother Joelle Waithe is Barbadian.[3][4] He holds British citizenship through his father.[5][6][7] He moved to England in 2015, and initially would not have been eligible to play for England until the winter of 2022. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) rules stated that as he did not live in England until after his 18th birthday, he needed to complete a seven-year residency period. Archer played for West Indies Under-19s three times in 2014, but had signalled his intention to make himself available to England once his residency period was complete.[8] However, in November 2018, the ECB announced a change to its rules, reducing the eligibility period from seven years to three to bring it into line with ICC regulations.[9][10]
