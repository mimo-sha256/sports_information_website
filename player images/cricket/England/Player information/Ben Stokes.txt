Benjamin Andrew Stokes (born 4 June 1991) is an English international cricketer and current vice-captain of the England Test team. Stokes was part of the England squad that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup.[2]

Born in Christchurch, New Zealand, Stokes moved to northern England with his parents at the age of 12,[3] where he learnt the game and began playing club cricket for local teams. He is an all-rounder who bowls right-arm fast-medium pace and bats left-handed.[4]

An attacking middle-order batsman, he holds the record for England's fastest ever Test double-century,[5] the fastest ever Test match 250, and the highest ever score for a Test batsman batting at number six. He also holds the record for the most runs scored by an individual batsman in the morning session of a Test match. Stokes became the highest-paid overseas player in the history of the Indian Premier League in 2017, fetching a record contract of ₹145 million ($2,166,604) (£1.7 million); he won the Most Valuable Player award during the season.
