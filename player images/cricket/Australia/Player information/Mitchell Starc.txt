Mitchell Aaron Starc (born 30 January 1990) is an Australian international cricketer who plays for the Australian national team and New South Wales in domestic cricket. He is a left-arm fast bowler and a capable lower order left-handed batsman. He was a prominent member of the victorious Australian squad that won the 2015 Cricket World Cup and was declared Player of the Tournament as a result of his consistent performances.[2] With 49 World Cup wickets, he is the joint 5th highest wicket taker in tournament's history.[3]

On 15 November 2015, Starc delivered the fastest recorded delivery in a Test match, of 160.4 km/h against Ross Taylor of New Zealand.[4] Starc then became the fastest bowler to take (over) 100 ODI wickets on 21 August 2016 against Sri Lanka, doing so in 52 innings and breaking Saqlain Mushtaq's 19-year-old record of taking 100 wickets in 53 innings. However, just 19 months later on 25 March 2018, Starc had his record broken by Rashid Khan, who took 100 wickets in only 44 innings.[5] As of February 2019, Starc nevertheless remains the fastest paceman to achieve the feat.

On 30 December 2016, against Pakistan in the Boxing Day Test, he broke Andrew Symonds' record of the most sixes at the MCG in one innings, hitting 7 sixes.

In November 2017, he became the first bowler to take a hat-trick in each innings of a Sheffield Shield match, while playing for New South Wales against Western Australia in the 2017â€“18 Sheffield Shield season.
