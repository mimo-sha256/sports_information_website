Shaun Edward Marsh (born 9 July 1983) is an Australian cricketer who plays for the Western Warriors in Australian domestic cricket and represents Australia in Test and One Day International formats. Nicknamed SOS ("Son of Swampy"),[3] he is a left-handed opening batsman.

Marsh is the first son of Geoff Marsh and elder brother of Mitchell Marsh, both of whom have played for the Australian national side.

Marsh is married to Channel 7 journalist Rebecca O'Donovan, now Rebecca Marsh. They have one child.[4] His brother-in-law is animator and Steam Train co-host Ross O'Donovan. He attended Wesley College in South Perth.

Off the field, Marsh has suffered from occasional lapses of discipline. In November 2007, he was suspended for two matches by the WACA for drinking alcohol to excess with teammate Luke Pomersbach.[5]

In October 2012, during the Champions League Twenty20 tournament in South Africa, Marsh was dropped from the Scorchers last game, along with brother Mitchell, after a night of partying to celebrate Mitchell's 21st birthday.[6]

In 2017, Marsh had an eye test, which showed he was short-sighted, a condition with which he had been batting and fielding for a considerable time. He started wearing contact lenses. This caused surprise in the cricket community, for whom Test match contracts normally include sight tests as a routine requirement.[7]
