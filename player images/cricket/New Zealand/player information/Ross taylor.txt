Luteru Ross Poutoa Lote Taylor (born 8 March 1984) is a New Zealand cricketer, who plays predominantly at number four in all formats of the game. Taylor set New Zealand's highest One Day International (ODI) score in February 2017[1] and in January 2019 scored his 20th century in ODIs, and became the first New Zealand player to reach 20 centuries in any format of the game.[2]He is considered to be one of the best batsmen to have represented New Zealand.

Taylor is of part-Samoan descent, his mother being from Samoa and his father from New Zealand. Taylor was educated at Wairarapa College and Palmerston North Boys High School[3] and was a hockey player before shifting his focus to cricket.[4] Taylor married his wife Victoria on 25 June 2011. They have three children.[5]

Taylor's full name is Luteru Ross Poutoa Lote Taylor; however, some sources have inaccurately recorded his name as Ross Luteru Taylor. This is because Taylor grew up answering to both Luteru and Ross when playing cricket, and did not realise he needed to write down his full name for the official New Zealand Cricket records when he was asked to fill in a questionnaire at a first-class match early in his career
