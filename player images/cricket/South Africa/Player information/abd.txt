Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984), commonly known as AB de Villiers, is a former international cricketer who has captained South African cricket team across all three formats. He was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year three times during his 15-year international career.

He played for Titans in South African domestic cricket and Delhi Daredevils & Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL). In limited overs cricket he is an attacking batsman.[2] He has the record of hitting the fastest ODI century in just 31 balls. He also records the fastest ODI 50,100 and 150.

De Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Noted as one of the most innovative batsmen in the modern game, de Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.[3]

He made his international debut in a Test match against England from 2004 and first played a One Day International (ODI) in early 2005. His debut in Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket and has a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the game.[4]

De Villiers captained South Africa in all three formats, although after a series of injuries he stepped down from the Test captaincy. In 2017 he stepped down from captaining the national limited-overs teams[5] and in May 2018 announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket.
