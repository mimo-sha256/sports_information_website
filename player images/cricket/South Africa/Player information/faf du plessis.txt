Francois "Faf" du Plessis (/ˈduːplɛsi/ DOO-pless-ee; born 13 July 1984) is a South African international cricketer and the current captain of the South African national team across ODI And Test formats.

A right-handed middle order batsman and part-time leg spin bowler, du Plessis has played South African domestic cricket for Northerns and the Titans, as well as matches for Lancashire, the Chennai Super Kings, the Rising Pune Supergiants and the Melbourne Renegades.

He made his Test debut in November 2012, he became the fourth South African to score a Test century on debut.[1] Du Plessis was subsequently also named T20 captain[2] of South Africa for the following Twenty20 series against New Zealand and confirmed full-time skipper in Feb 2013.[3]

Du Plessis took over the Test captaincy in December 2016 and assumed full-time captaincy in all formats of the game in August 2017 after teammate and former captain AB de Villiers relinquished the two limited overs captaincies.[4][5]

Du Plessis was on a 6-month contract with Lancashire for the 2008 season starting in April as a Kolpak player after impressing the board with good performances in the local Nottinghamshire leagues for Mansfield Hosiery Mills and in the Lancashire League for Todmorden.[6][7] Du Plessis started his Lancashire account by scoring 55 against Durham UCCE before being dismissed by opening bowler Foster. Following his six-month stint with Lancashire, du Plessis signed a new three-year deal with the club. Lancashire coach Mike Watkinson praised du Plessis' fielding, saying "if there's a better fielder in county cricket I've not seen him this season".[8] In March 2010, it was announced that du Plessis would no longer be allowed to play for Lancashire as a Kolpak player after changes to the Kolpak rules. In 2011, he was signed by the 2010 IPL Champions Chennai Super Kings for US$120,000 at the Indian Premier League player auction.
