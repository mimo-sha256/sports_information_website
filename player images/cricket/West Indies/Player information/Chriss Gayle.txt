Christopher Henry Gayle, OD (born 21 September 1979) is a Jamaican cricketer who plays international cricket for the West Indies.[3] Gayle captained the West Indies Test side from 2007 to 2010. Considered as one of the greatest batsmen ever in Twenty20 (T20) cricket, Gayle has set numerous records across all three formats of cricket. He is the most capped player for the West Indies in international cricket. He is the only player to score a triplet of centuries - a triple hundred in Tests, double hundred in ODIs and a hundred in T20Is.

In February 2019, Gayle announced that he would retire from ODIs after the 2019 Cricket World Cup.[4] However, in June 2019, during the Cricket World Cup, Gayle expressed his desire to play in the ODI matches against India in August, and possibly a Test match as well.[5] Gayle last played in a Test match in September 2014, against Bangladesh.[5] In July 2019, he was named in the West Indies' ODI squad for their series against India.[6] During the series against India, Gayle played in his 300th ODI, which includes three matches for the ICC World XI team.[7] In the same match, Gayle also became the leading run-scorer for a West Indies batsman in ODI cricket. He went past Brian Lara's record of 10,348 runs.[8]
