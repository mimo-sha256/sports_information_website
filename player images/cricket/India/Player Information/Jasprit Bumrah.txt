Jasprit Jasbirsingh Bumrah (born 6 December 1993) is an Indian cricketer who plays for the Indian national cricket team in all formats of the game. After a couple of moderately successful seasons with the Mumbai Indians at the Indian Premier League, and with his domestic team Gujarat, he was named in India's squad for its 2015–16 series against Australia, as a replacement to an injured Bhuvneshwar Kumar.[2] He consequently made his debut in One Day Internationals & Twenty20 Internationals in 2015–16 series against Australia. He is the first Asian bowler to take 5 wickets in a test innings in South Africa, England and Australia during the same calendar year.[citation needed] He is also tḥe third highest wicket taker in test matches in a debut year with 48 wickets in 8 matches.[citation needed]


Bumrah plays first-class cricket for Gujarat and he made his debut against Vidarbha in October 2013 during the 2013–14 season.[3] He picked up 7 wickets in the match. Eventually, he ended the tournament as the side's leading wicket-taker.

A right-arm fast-medium pacer from Gujarat with an unusual bowling action, Bumrah made his T20 debut against Maharashtra in the 2012–13 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, and also helped his side clinch the title with his Man of the Match performance. His figures of 3/14 were instrumental to Gujarat's win over Punjab in the final.[4]

A 19-year old Bumrah grabbed instant limelight when on his Indian Premier League debut, he finished with figures of 3/32 against RCB.[5] While doing so, he became only the second bowler in the side to take three wickets on debut. Though he played just a couple of games in the Pepsi IPL 2013 for Mumbai Indians, his impressive show in the domestic circuit convinced the Mumbai Indians management to buy him back for Pepsi IPL 2014 season.[6] He was named in the IPL XI of the tournament in 2017 by Cricbuzz.[7] In 2018 he took 78 wickets.

He was also named in the T20 XI of the years 2016 and 2017 by ESPNCricinfo and in 2017 by Cricbuzz.
